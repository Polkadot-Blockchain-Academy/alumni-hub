# Employment in the ecosystem

We have launched <a href="https://pba-alumni-jobs.myjboard.io/" target="_blank">https://pba-alumni-jobs.myjboard.io/</a> which is a PBA Alumni only job board, this is where ecosystem teams go to find PBA Alumni to hire. We're excited about this!

There is also <a href="https://polkadot.getro.com/jobs" target="_blank">https://polkadot.getro.com/jobs</a> which is a Polkadot/Parity controlled aggregator of Polkadot ecosystem teams, this site relies on upkeep by Parity. 

This Getro powered site aggregates data from ecosystem team career pages and collates it here in a searchable way.

Additionally <a href="https://parachains.info/" target="_blank">https://parachains.info/</a> is a useful resource for researching ecosystem teams as well as investors in the Polkadot ecosystem, although this is not technically a recruiting resource, it is useful for research.
