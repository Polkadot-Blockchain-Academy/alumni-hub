### Purpose

We have created these Community Guidelines to keep the Alumni community and its respective communication channels and interactions (both offline and online) warm, welcoming, and on topic. 

The rules are few, simple and are generally recognizable as common decency. 

### Community Values

- Work on creating a world of less trust and more truth by building unstoppable Web3 technology.
- Create a safe environment, where community members want to gather, connect and promote common interests.
- Create a culture of support and mutual respect.

### Be Kind and Respectful

Together let’s build a positive and welcoming environment, where everyone can share their ideas and thoughts on blockchain and Polkadot related topics. 

- Be tolerant towards other’s viewpoints; respectfully disagree when opinions do not align
- Respect the privacy and personal information of other alumni
- Communicate with courtesy and respect

### Be Relevant

The PBA Alumni members have united to share their common interest and passion for Web3 technologies and principals.

- Remain on-topic, make posts and start discussions that are relevant to the community’s purpose
- We welcome debate and dissent which are conducted in a respectful manner and which use constructive and focused argumentation

### Zero Tolerance

Please take note of behaviour and content that will not be tolerated within our community:

- Trolling and personal attacks on other community members
- Using defamatory remarks or making false statements against others
- Posting prejudiced comments
- Bullying or making inflammatory remarks to other community members
- Posting obviously commercial or spam-like information
- Violating any laws or regulations
- Engaging in conduct which is or could be considered defamatory, indecent, hateful, discriminatory, harmful or in a way others might find inappropriate

### **Moderation Approach**

The Academy Team will take action when someone is violating the Community Guidelines. 

Members who seriously, persistently or wilfully ignore the Community Guidelines will have their posting privileges for all the Alumni community areas withdrawn.

Depending on the nature of the offense this may result in a total ban from the community.

Please be aware that you may be contacted directly by email (or via an online call) in relation to your participation. 


### **Agreement**

By joining the Polkadot Blockchain Academy Alumni, all members are considered to be in agreement with the terms and conditions listed above, and are expected to uphold them.
