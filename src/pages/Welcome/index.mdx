## Scope

The aim of this site is to provide you with an easy to use guide to help you
understand and explore the options you have to participate in the Polkadot
ecosystem. Completing the PBA is just the start. This is also the place to
come to keep in touch with Alumni from your wave, get to know other Alumni and
also to stay close to Faculty and PBA staff. We want the PBA Alumni to be a
safe space for everyone. Therefore we have created Community Guidelines to
serve as a code of conduct for whenever we meet in person or online.
