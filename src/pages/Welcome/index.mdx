# Message to the PBA Alumni Network

<YouTube id="VTENSTYZmyo" width="calc(80vw)" />

## Scope

The aim of this site is to provide you with an easy to use guide to help you understand and explore the options you have to participate in the Polkadot ecosystem. Completing the PBA was just the start.

This is also the place to come to keep in touch with Alumni from your wave, get to know other Alumni and also to stay close to Faculty and PBA staff.

We want the PBA Alumni to be a safe space for everyone. Therefore we have created <a href="https://hackmd.io/BVt37HwzTieCt13yHdfT2w?view" target="_blank">Community Guidelines</a> to serve as a code of conduct for whenever we meet in person or online.

## Polkadot

The two most important sites for anyone interested in Polkadot to be aware of are the below, the Polkadot website and forum, these sites are good places to start your online journey into the ecosystem.
